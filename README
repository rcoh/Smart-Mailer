Smartmailer is an intelligent emailer designed for MIT moira-based email lists.  It allows you to send messages to
intersections and differences of lists and users.  
For example:
conner5.minus.grts would send to all members of conner5 /except/ the members of conner5 who are also
in the grt list.

climbers.intersect.ec-discuss would send to all members who are on both climbers and ec-discuss.

The service is currently hosted at mitsmartmail@gmail.com.  To send messages to it use
mitsmartmail+yourconstraints@gmail.com -- eg: mitsmartmail+conner5.minus.grts@gmail.com

The service is absolutley and completely use at your own risk.  YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T USE IT AT
ALL.

The python code contained is designed to read from a POP3 address, perform the relevant transforms,
the resends the message using an SMTP address.

It only works on public lists.  It will deference lists -- messages get CCed to lots of individual
addresses.
