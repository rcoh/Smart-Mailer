Smartmailer is an intelligent emailer designed for MIT moira-based email lists.  It allows you to send messages to
intersections and differences of lists and users.  
For example:
conner5.minus.grts would send to all members of conner5 /except/ the members of conner5 who are also
in the grt list.

climbers.intersect.ec-discuss would send to all members who are on both climbers and ec-discuss.

You need to provide your own POP3 and SMTP servers (or use gmail).  It reads information after the "+" in the address.
You should send mail to myaddress+constraints@myserver.com to user it.  

The python code contained is designed to read from a POP3 address, perform the relevant transforms,
the resends the message using an SMTP address.

It only works on public lists.  It will deference lists -- messages get CCed to lots of individual
addresses.
